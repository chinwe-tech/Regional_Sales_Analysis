# 🌍 Regional Sales Distribution Analysis

This project analyzes **sales distribution across regions** using a **Treemap visualization**.  
The treemap allows us to quickly identify which regions contribute the most to overall performance.  

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Compare sales contributions across four regions: **Central, East, West, and South**.  
- Highlight the dominant region in terms of total sales.  
- Provide insights for regional resource allocation and strategy.

- **Largest Block (Central):** Indicates Central is the top-performing region.  
- **Medium Blocks (East, West):** Represent moderate sales contributions.  
- **Smallest Block (South):** Indicates the lowest sales among all regions.  

---

## 🔎 Insights
- **Central region dominates** sales compared to all other regions.  
- **East and West** regions are close in size, representing mid-level performance.  
- **South region lags** significantly, showing the smallest contribution to sales.  

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
- Business focus should remain strong in **Central** (to maintain dominance), while strategies should target **South** for growth opportunities.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau / Excel** for visualization  
- **Treemap Chart** for hierarchical representation of sales distribution  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Drill down into **product-level performance** within each region.  
- Compare sales distribution with **profitability** to see if high sales = high profit.  
- Investigate reasons behind the **South region’s low performance**.
